# WebAssembly / AssemblyScript Atari 2600 Emulator 

I've been fascinated with the 2600 ever since reading [Racing the Beam](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Racing-Beam-Computer-Platform-Studies/dp/026201257X), the idea of a computer that doesn't have enough memory to support video RAM is just nuts! This project is an excuse to have a play with [AssemblyScript](https://docs.assemblyscript.org/), and explore the 2600 further.

I'm implementing the 2600 by implementing features as they appear in the [Atari 2600 Programming for Newbies](https://cdn.hackaday.io/files/1646277043401568/Atari_2600_Programming_for_Newbies_Revised_Edition.pdf) guide.
